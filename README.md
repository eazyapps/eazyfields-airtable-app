## Installation

1. This is a custom app. To install custom blocks, you need to join Airtable's custom blocks developer preview, by filling [this form](https://airtable.com/shrEvq5IlQqYxWkaS).

2. Follow the instructions [here](https://airtable.com/developers/blocks/guides/hello-world-tutorial#create-a-new-block) to create a new block - but in _Start from an example_, choose _Remix from GitHub_ and in _GitHub repository_, enter the URL for this repository:

https://github.com/superblocks-at/eazyfields-block

3. Install the block into your base by releasing it, using the following command:

```
block release
```

## Contributions

Are more than welcome. The goal is to have the community expand the block and it's field selection so that the entire Airtable community can benefit.

Some things that might benefit the community:

- Option to create the field as a linked record to a new table with the pre-populated values.

- Option to create the field as a multiple select field.

- Support for displaying different languages in different Airtable forms. If someone wants to add this, feel free to open an issue so I can suggest one possible way of implementing this.

## Implementation details

This block uses:

1. Data from [CLDR](http://cldr.unicode.org/) (the unicode common locale data repository) for localized country, month and day names. The software library used to get CLDR data is the compact and performant [@phensley/cldr](@phensley/cldr) npm package.

2. The amazing [mobx library](https://mobx.js.org/README.html) for state management. Mobx promotes clear separation between view (react components), and state / view model (the data they depend on for rendering), which:

- Reduces code size and complexity.
- Allows for easier and faster testing.
- Creates components that re-render truly only when something they directly depend on in their rendering changes.
